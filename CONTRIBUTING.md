Hello and thank you for looking to improve the Git Style Guide.

* If you want to translate the style guide, fork the repository and add your
translation in your fork (edit `README.md`). Then open a pull request that adds the link to your fork (note that languages are listed alphabetically).
* Please follow the [style guide](README.md)!

Thanks!
